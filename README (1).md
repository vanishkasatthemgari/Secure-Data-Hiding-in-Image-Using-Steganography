# Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements **image-based steganography** to securely hide messages within images. Using Python and OpenCV, the system encodes text messages into pixel values, ensuring **invisible data transmission**. A **password-protected decryption** mechanism ensures that only authorized users can extract the hidden message.

## 🛠️ Installation  
Ensure you have **Python 3+** installed, then install the required library:  

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## 🚀 How to Use  

### 🔑 Encoding (Hiding a Message)  
1️⃣ Run the `stego.py` script:  
```bash
python stego.py
```  
2️⃣ Enter the **secret message** when prompted.  
3️⃣ Provide a **password** for security.  
4️⃣ The script will generate an **Encrypted Image (`Encryptedmsg.jpg`)** with the hidden message.  

---

### 🔓 Decoding (Retrieving the Message)  
1️⃣ Run the script again:  
```bash
python stego.py
```  
2️⃣ Enter the **decryption password** when prompted.  
3️⃣ If the password is correct, the **hidden message** will be displayed.  
4️⃣ If the password is incorrect, access is denied.

## 🎯 Use Cases  
🔹 **Secure communication** for military & government agencies.  
🔹 **Data hiding** for cyber forensics & digital investigations.  
🔹 **Confidential messaging** for journalists & whistleblowers.  
🔹 **Private messaging** for general users.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements  
✅ Implement **audio & video** steganography.  
✅ Improve **encryption algorithms** for enhanced security.  
✅ Integrate with **cloud-based secure messaging systems**.  
✅ Develop **AI-based steganalysis** to detect unauthorized hidden messages.
